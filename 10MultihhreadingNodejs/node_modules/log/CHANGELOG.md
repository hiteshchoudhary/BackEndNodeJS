# [3.0.0](https://github.com/medikoo/log4/compare/v2.0.0...v3.0.0) (2018-06-01)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Predefined levels are no longer accessible at `logger.predefinedLevels` property.
  Instead they should be required from `log4/levels`
- For simplicity and to avoid compliance issues,
  only predefined levels are allowed (it's no
  longer possible to create custom named levels)
- `enable()` and `disable()` methods no logger return own logger.
  Instead they return plain object with `restore` function, that allows to restore to previous state
- `getNs` method has been renamed to
  `get`
- `ns` property has been renamed to
  `namespace`
- `nsTokens` property has been renamed to
  `namespaceTokens`
- Emitter is not longer accessible at logger.emiter
  Instead it should be required from `log4/emitter`
- `getAllLevels` method has been renamed to
  `getAllInitializedLevels`
- `hasLevel` method has been renamed to
  `isLevelInitialized`
- `hasNs` method has been renamed to
  `isNamespaceInitialized`
- New setupVisibility accepts:

  - `levelThreshold` - on its basis it's decided logs for which levels are
    enabled by default

  - `debugNamespaceToken` - List of namespaces to be exposed for
    levels below threshold

- `getLevel` method was removed. Use direct property names:
  `log.error` instead of `log.getLevel("error")`

  `getAllInitializedNamespaces`
